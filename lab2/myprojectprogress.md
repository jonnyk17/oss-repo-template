I would like to do a application where RPI athletes can track their workouts and PRs. They can then use the app to compare with other RPI athletes. Coaches can also post workout plans, 
game clips, notes etc for their athletes. Sending workout plans would be big in the offseason for mass communication and coaches can also use it to track players progress
throughout the season and offseason. I believe a common repo would be best as it allows everyone to contribute evenly.
