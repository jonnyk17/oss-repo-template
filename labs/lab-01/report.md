### Free Culture

  Jesse was an RPI IT student who began tinkering with premade search engines. He was using open source code and tinkered with it to make is suitable for the RPI network. He used Microsoft's network file system to build an index of all of RPI's shared files within the network. The network contained anything that users had stored in public folders including music. These music files were then publicly accessible by everyone on the network. The music, however, was copyrighted and led to a huge lawsuit against Jesse from the RIAA since he managed the network. Even when you have access to files from a public source, those files could be copyrighted. When you mass distribute those copyrighted files over a large public network it can cause a lot of legal issues. When managing a network, you have to verify that each file is free to be distributed to the public and does not contain any copyrights before adding it to the public network. If Jesse had done this he would have avoided a major lawsuit from the RIAA.
