### How to answer questions helpfully
Point people in the direction of helpful resources or links that you have come across that have helped you in the past or that you found while searching for their problem.

If you have time try looking at the code as a whole and suggest work arounds or fixes to the error

### Free Culture

  Jesse was an RPI IT student who began tinkering with premade search engines. He was using open source code and tinkered with it to make is suitable for the RPI network. He used Microsoft's network file system to build an index of all of RPI's shared files within the network. The network contained anything that users had stored in public folders including music. These music files were then publicly accessible by everyone on the network. The music, however, was copyrighted and led to a huge lawsuit against Jesse from the RIAA since he managed the network. Even when you have access to files from a public source, those files could be copyrighted. When you mass distribute those copyrighted files over a large public network it can cause a lot of legal issues. When managing a network, you have to verify that each file is free to be distributed to the public and does not contain any copyrights before adding it to the public network. If Jesse had done this he would have avoided a major lawsuit from the RIAA.

## Open Source project

An open source project I would like to build would a web application where users can log in and create a player profile and interact with other athletes. On this site you can add different events that you competed in(i.e. 100m, bench press, vertical jump) and compare with their athletes on the site. You will be able to see how you compare to other athletes in the same sport as you or same age bracket. I would like there to be visual graphs that show the comparisons of the athletes stats as well as a page that shows all the athletes and can be filtered by name and/or event. I would like to add a way to follow athletes as well and for there to be a page that shows updates to those accounts that you follow. It will have some sort of frontend framework, a database and an API to retrieve information from that database.
