## Build


## Executing tests

You can see the test summary of each build at the bottom of that build's page. Errors for builds are displayed in the test summary. If you clicked the failed test it will show you
the expected output and the actual output. This is helpful when tracing back build errors. In the master section the cmake-debian10_iwyu build is close to my configuration.
The dashboard is very clean and there are no errors.
