## Why is it imporant to have licenses
 
 Licenses establish permission first to use, study modify and redistribute the software. It sets a common standard that's apodbted by all contributers and encourages more contributers.
 
 ## Why you shouldn't use software with no explicit licenses
 
 There won't be a standard set on the software developed. It also won't be appoved by the OSI. It is unlikely to be a successful open source project.
 
 ## Open system model
 
 I do agree with the claim for why the web beat Gopher. I think releasing their softwrae to the public early was the best. You want to fail faster and nothing is better than getting feedback directly from your users. This is going to allow developers to target their problems and for the open source community it's going to drive up engagement and bug fixes for software they intend to use.
 
## Why Android uses the Apache license 2.0

ASL makes it possibel for propretary companies to use open source code and modify it without turning it back over to the open source community. It encourages commericial apdoption of open source software as they make profit off the enhancements they contribute to the projects. Also ASL allows android to be avaiable to other comapnies allowing for them to adopt the platfrom and buiold on top of it without exposing their proprietary unique changes.
